# MyReads Project

This is my submit of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. Every student attending to the React Nanodegree has to provide this project.
You can find the starter template [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

It's purpose is to find books directly from a search page and to classify them under 3 states/shelves : Currently reading, Want to read and Read.

## TL;DR

To test the project right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
